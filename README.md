# Adventure-Works-Data-Engineering-Project-2

## Overview

This project is End-to-End Data Engineering project from scratch where I leverage powerful technologies like Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake, Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Apache Spark.


## Project Goals

- Data Ingestion: Build a mechanism is to ingest data from Github.
- ETL System: We are getting data in raw format, transforming this data into the proper format.
- Data lake: We will be getting data from multiple sources so we need centralized repo to store them.
- Cloud: We canâ€™t process vast amounts of data on our local computer so we need to use the cloud, in this case, we will use Azure.
- Reporting: Build a dashboard to get answers to the questions.

## Services we will be using

- Azure is a cloud computing platform offering services for building, deploying, and managing applications globally.
- How to design and implement a robust data pipeline using Azure Data Factory.
- Azure Data Lake Gen is a scalable, secure data storage service optimized for big data analytics.
- The process of data integration and transformation with Databricks.
- Utilizing Azure Synapse Analytics for efficient data warehousing and analytics.
- Best practices for handling big data solutions and real-time data processing with Apache Spark.
- Power BI is a business analytics tool for interactive visualizations and data-driven insights.
