# Adventure-Works-Data-Engineering-Project-2

## Overview

This project is End-to-End Data Engineering project from scratch where I leverage powerful technologies like Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake, Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Apache Spark.


## Project Goals

- Data Ingestion: Build a mechanism is to ingest data from Github.
- ETL System: We are getting data in raw format, transforming this data into the proper format.
- Data lake: We will be getting data from multiple sources so we need centralized repo to store them.
- Cloud: We canâ€™t process vast amounts of data on our local computer so we need to use the cloud, in this case, we will use Azure.
- Reporting: Build a dashboard to get answers to the questions.

## Services we will be using

- Azure is a cloud computing platform offering services for building, deploying, and managing applications globally.
- How to design and implement a robust data pipeline using Azure Data Factory.
- Azure Data Lake Gen is a scalable, secure data storage service optimized for big data analytics.
- The process of data integration and transformation with Databricks.
- Utilizing Azure Synapse Analytics for efficient data warehousing and analytics.
- Best practices for handling big data solutions and real-time data processing with Apache Spark.
- Power BI is a business analytics tool for interactive visualizations and data-driven insights.

## Dataset Used

This dataset is very popular and available in the world of data engineering, data analytics, data science that's why I picked this data set let me tell you this data set was full of tables and this gives you an advantage with when you showcase your project that involved so many tables because they know that this person has applied so many joints so many lookups while completing this project so this gives you an advantage and that's why I also took this data set.
